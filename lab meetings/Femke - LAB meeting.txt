Descending neurons convey info from the brain to the VNC

connectome dataset
Different types of NN:   Random, small world, scale-free

Power-law fit corresponds to scale-free

The drosophilia has a NN which looks like a power-law fit --> scale-free which is really hierarchical
-->Drosophilia NN is really organized

Louvain community detection allowed to have a good clustering

Excitatory neurons are within the clusters
Inhibitory neurons are between clusters
