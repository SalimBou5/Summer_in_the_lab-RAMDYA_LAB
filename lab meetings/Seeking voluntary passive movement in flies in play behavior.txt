Seeking voluntary passive movement in flies in play-like behavior (tilman Triphan, Wolf Huetteroth)

Play = Belonid gish leaping over a turtle
Play = Ants play fighting  

Play 
   * does not contribute to current survival
   * spontaneous, voluntary, intentional, pleasurable, rewarding, reinforcing or autotelic
   * Differs from the "serious" performance of ethotypic behavior structurally or temporally in at least one respect
	(Ethotypic behaviour means behaviour which is typical for an animal species in a given environment)
   * Repeated in a similar but not rigidly stereotyped form
   * Initiated when an animal is adequately fed, healthy and free from stress
