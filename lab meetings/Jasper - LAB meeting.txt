The transformation of intentions into movements in adult drosophilia 

Sensations--> perceptions --> intentnions --> movements

The black box between intention and movement:
Intention --> descending neurons --> premotor neurons --> motor neurons --> muscles --> movement

Stephen huston


To avoid this blackbox, a backward strategy is the best way "in his opinion"  --> start from the movement and go backwards to the intentions

Some sensory neurons detect vibration. Other detect position and others directional movement

Using connectomics to map motor and premotor circuits

Most motor neurons have unique identifiable morphologies

John tuthill's lab --> mapped each motor neuron's muscle target


Two-photon calcium imaging from one motor neuron during behaviour  --> frame rate is too low (because scans pixel by pixel)--> new microscopes for faster imaging --> *light sheet microscope for 100x faster 3D calcium imaging,  *epifluorescence microscopy for 1000x faster voltage imaging

*Single objective light-sheet microscopy (SCAPE) --> faster (scans the whole sample at once --> higher frame rate) BUT less resolution + less depth --> speed is much more important
*Voltage imaging with a fast epifluorescence scope (voltage indicators) --> characterization of new lines
