louise MA4 robotics
Biorob --> modeling of the salamander locomotion
mondada (mobots) -->Modelling emergent thermal dyanmics in a robot-bee biohybrid system
neuromechfly : vision-based tracking
--->implement locomotion with CPGs and turning by modulation of oscillator amplitudes
--->reinforcement learning to train tracking

Sibo --> Neuromechfly
How does the fly walk?
designing and implementing artificial controllers to drive a simulated fly
behaviour is more important that aspect
developing software
coupled-oscillators (each one control a muscle)
Artificial Neural Network -> Deep Reinforcement Learning 

higher-order sensory input : 
	1/vision : antennas obstructing the view in the simulation-->maybe in reality the focal length of the eye makes it invisible for the fly
	2/olfaction
