Victor - LAB meeting

Socaibility among drosophilas --> ease around conspecifics

Safety in numbers

flies are sociable but not at the beginning --> at the start, they are scared

neural dynamics associated with the emergence of sociabilty using drosophila as a model organism

control exxperiments- --> un groupe isolated et un autre grouped, après on fait 3 expériences
	*2 isolated  
	*2 grouped
	*1 isolated + 1 grouped

Results: sociabilty is a learned behaviour --> It's mediated by vision and olfaction 
	After 2 hours, their "sociability" reaches a plateau


Drosohoila simulans are clsoe to melanogaster in evolution (just 2 million years)
They are very similar, just a little bit smaller

Drosophilia sechelia
also very silmilar to melanogaster, they need special fruit (noni) to lay eggs and don't like cold temperatures, cannot climb on the arenas

Drosophila mojavensis
different to melanogaster, bigger, males don't have sex combs --> can't tell if they are male or female before eclosion. After eclosion, the color of the abdomen can tell the sex of the drosophila. They might have a different activity level profile


The parents' age leads to chemical changes in the progeny. (change in chemicals in their body (like their smell))
older parents(4 to 12 days) give active progeny 

Melanogaster + simulans : not getting along as fast as 2 melanogasters

Melanogaster + sechelia : Sechelia moving heratically so difficult to understand --> Not working with sechelia in future experiments

Melanogaster + mojavensis wrigleyi: mojavensis stay at the center far from melanogaster which spend their time at the border, mojavensis are way less active. 
Melanogaster need to see somtehing moving to consider them.

Summary:
	Other drosohilids show isolated-like behaviours during the two hours
	It looks like other drosophilids don't learn to be social at least not as fast as melanogaster

Preventing synaptic transmission from 160 types of neurons:  (Aso, Y., et al., eLife, 2014)
	olfactory receptor neurons
	visual neurons
	mushroom body: memory center
	lateral horn: innate behaviors center
	neuropeptides
	Others: pC1, PNs

The mushroom body modulates its neural circuits for making a fly social
The lateral horn could play a roll
